--------

This sample application will show the way to use print engine calls in your 
application.  The following are the steps for using the print engine calls. 

1.  PEOpenEngine - This call opens the print engine and prepares it to accept a print
                job.  From the menu bar of CRPE.EXE, select the "Engine|Open" command.

		
2.  PEOpenPrintJob - This call opens the print job(report) and prepares the job for 
		the print job.  From the menu bar, select the "Job|Open" command.

3.  PEOutputToFile - These 3 calls set the print destination for the job selected. This 
  		is found on the menu bar using the  "Job|Output to File" command.

    PEOutputToWindow - This call is found on the menu bar "Job|Output to Window"
		There are 2 commands allowing you to set the output to the window.
		"Set output to Top-Level Window" and "Set Output to Child Window" use
		the same print engine call, the difference being the Top-Level Window
		has the ParentWindowHandle set as a null.

    PEOutputToPrinter - This call directs the print job to the printer. The command for
		this can be found under the menu command "Job|Set Output To Printer".


4.  PEStartPrintJob - This call starts the print job. The command in CRPETEST.EXE is 
		found at the "Job|Start" menu command.

5.  PEClosePrintJob - This call is used to close the print job.  This call is a 
		mandatory part of each custom-print link to shut done the print job 
		once it has finished printing to the window.  The menu command for this
		call is "Job|Close".

6.  PECloseEngine - This call terminates the print engine.  All printing is stopped 
		and windows are closed.  This call can be found under the menu command
		"Engine|Close".


SQL Databases
-------------
    These calls would be used if you needed to log onto a SQL type database.

    PEGetNthTableLogonInfo - This call allows the application to get the proper logon 
		information for the table being used by the print job.  This call is 
		under the menu command "Files|Get first Tables Logon Info".

    PESetNthTableLogonInfo - This call sets the proper logon information for the print
		job. This call is found at the menu call "Files|Set first tables logon Info".

    PEGetNthTableLocation - This call obtains the tables location for use with the print job.
		This is found at "Files|Get Table Location".

    PESetNthTableLocation - This call sets the table location for the print job.  This call is
		found under the menu command "Files|Set table Location".

These steps show the minimum functionality of the print engine calls.  The remaining 
calls that are present in the CRPETEST.EXE are described, with syntax, in chapter 8 of
the Crystal Reports manual "The CR PrintEngine".
