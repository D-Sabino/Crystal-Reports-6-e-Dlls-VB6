you (either an individual or a single entity) and Seagate 
Software, Inc. (herein referred to as "Seagate Software") for 
the Seagate Crystal Reports software product, which 
includes computer software and associated media, printed 
materials, and "on-line" or electronic documentation (herein 
referred to as "Software Product"). By opening the sealed 
software package and/or by installing, copying or otherwise 
using the Software Product, you agree to be bound by the 
terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of 
this Agreement, promptly return the Software Product and 
accompanying items in resalable condition to the place from 
which you obtained them for a full refund.

to use the Software Product as described in the attached 
Exhibit 1, and are acquiring no rights to the software

copies of the Software Product.
4.	LIMITED WARRANTY.  Unless this is a "Not for 
Resale" or "Evaluation " product,  Seagate Software 
warrants the physical disk(s) and physical documentation 
to be free of defects in materials and workmanship for a 
period of 60 days from the purchase date. If Seagate 
Software receives notification within this warranty 
period of any such defects and such notification is 
determined to be correct, Seagate Software will replace 
the disk(s) or documentation.  Seagate Software's entire 
liability for any breach of this warranty is limited to 
replacement of defective disk(s) or documentation, and 
does not include or extend to claims for any other 
damages.
SEAGATE SOFTWARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS 
ALL OTHER CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES, 
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR 
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
ANY IMPLIED CONDITION OR WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR SATISFACTORY 
QUALITY.
"Not for Resale" and "Evaluation" products are 
provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.  
Seagate Software does not guarantee results or warrant 
that these products will be error-free.
5.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
SEAGATE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR COSTS OF 
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, 
LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA OR USE OF THE 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, OR SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
OR OTHER SIMILAR CLAIMS, HOWEVER 
CAUSED, AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
EVEN IF SEAGATE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN 
SPECIFICALLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL 
SEAGATE SOFTWARE'S LIABILITY FOR ANY 
DAMAGES TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON 
EVER EXCEED THE LOWER OF THE SUGGESTED 
LIST PRICE OR THE ACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE 
PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, 
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM. 
THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY 
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF 
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. 
ALL THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS TO SEAGATE 
SOFTWARE OF ANY PORTION OF THE 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT MAKE NO WARRANTY 
AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU.
6.	RUNTIME SOFTWARE. The software files listed in the 
software file runtime.hlp, provided on your software 
disk(s), individually, collectively or in any combination, 
constitute Runtime Software. Unless this is a "Not for 
Resale" or "Evaluation" product, Seagate Software 
grants you a Limited Runtime License to reproduce and 
distribute exact copies of the Runtime Software, and to 
modify, reproduce and distribute the sample applications 
made from the original disks in this package (or a set of 
backup copies made directly from them), if and only if 
all of the following conditions are satisfied:
6(a).  you may distribute such copies solely for the 
purpose of executing specific-purpose application 
programs written using an authorized copy of 
Software Product;
6(b).  you remain solely responsible for support, service, 
upgrades, and technical or other assistance, 
required or requested by anyone receiving such 
copies;
6(c).  you may not use the name, logo, or trademark of 
Seagate Software or the Software Product without 
written permission from Seagate Software;
6(d).  you may not alter, disassemble, decompile, 
translate, adapt or reverse-engineer the Runtime 
Software;
6(e).  Seagate Software makes no warranty other than the 
Limited License warranty provided in this 
agreement to you; and 
6(f).  you will indemnify Seagate Software against any 
claims or liabilities arising out of its use, 
reproduction or distribution, and the use by the 
recipients or copies made thereunder.
You may not include the Runtime Software or sample 
applications in any general-purpose report writing and/or 
database querying product, or any other product that is 
generally competitive with Seagate Software product 
offerings, nor may you use the Software Product to 
create a product that is generally competitive with 
Seagate Software product offerings. If you wish to 
distribute copies of the Runtime Software or sample 
applications on other terms, you must obtain written 
permission from Seagate Software.
"Not for Resale" and "Evaluation" products do not 
include a Limited Runtime License, and you may not, 
therefore, distribute Runtime Software or sample 
applications.
The Software Product contains software components 
from Seagate Software suppliers. This Agreement does 
not grant you the rights to distribute software 
components from these suppliers, including but not 
limited to, Microsoft Corporation's "JET Files", unless 
you have proper authorization from the appropriate 
supplier.
7.	GOVERNING LAW. If you acquired this product in 
Canada, this Agreement is governed by the laws of the 
Province of British Columbia, Canada, without regard, 
and each party irrevocably attorns to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts of the Province or British 
Columbia. If you acquired this product in the United 
States or elsewhere other than Canada, this Agreement is 
governed by the laws of the State of California, without 
regard to its conflict of laws provision, and each party 
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of the State of California.  The parties disclaim the 
application of the United Nations Convention on the 
International Sale of Goods.
8.	MISCELLANEOUS. This document constitutes the 
entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject 
matter herein. All rights not expressly granted to you are 
retained by Seagate Software.  The failure of Seagate 
Software to enforce any right or claim against you shall 
not be deemed a waiver of such right or claim or any 
other right or claim hereunder.  No modification to this 
Agreement shall have effect unless in writing and signed 
by the authorized representative of the parties.  If any 
provision of this Agreement is ruled invalid, such 
invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining 
portions of this Agreement.
