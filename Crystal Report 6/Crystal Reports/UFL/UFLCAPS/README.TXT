UFLCAPS.DLL
-----------

The User Defined Function (UFL) that appears in the formula editor
is called LeadingCaps(string).

This function converts a string so that capital letters are at the 
beginning of each word in the string.

The sample string 

  "tHiS IS THE uflcaps-conVERTed strinG."

will be changed to

  "This Is The Uflcaps-Converted String."

Note that letters following space, tab and hyphen characters are
capitalized.
